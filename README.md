# Houdini bakes attributes to PNG files

## System requirement: 
Develop and tested on Houdini Indie 19.5

## For what?
I need a pipeline to bake P and Cd attributes to PNG files and then import them to three.js for websites use.

## Three.js app
I created this [threejs code](https://github.com/rc-bellergy/threejs-particles-from-png) that can decode the PNG files and convert the data to particles.
